# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performed analysis on Kickstarter campaigns to uncover fundraising trends for theater and plays in the US and Great Britain.

Louise crowdfunding budget of $10,000 what makes a caompaign successful and how can we set up Louise for success. We want to help her set up a campaign that is simlar to other successful campaigns. 

## Summary
Theater campaigns make up the largest category of campaigns on Kickstarter and have a high success rate in both the US and Great Britain. Success rates in the US are 57.5%, in Great Britain are 71.8% , and combined are 61.6%. Looking further into the Theater category we found plays to be the the largest subcategory with 985 campaigns (US:671 , GB:314) with 650 successful fundarising efforts (US:412 GB:238).

We recommend starting the campaign in the summer, May through July. These months had the highest number of successful campaign launches. 

Raising the full $10,000 budget from a single campaign is less likely to be successful. Successful campaigns tended to target around a $3,000 goal in the US and a $2,000 goal in GB. Overall, the median campaign attempted to raise $5,000 which is the beginning of the upper quartile of successful campaigns. We think targetting a goal of $3,000 to $5,000 will set up the campaign for the most success. 

### Campaign Timing
The timing of the campaign may play a significant role in its success. Campaigns launched in the summer months had a greater chance of meeting their goals than campaigns launched later in the year. Specifically, May, June, and July campaigns saw the greatest number of successful campaigns. November, December, Janaury, and March had the least number of successful campaign launches.
